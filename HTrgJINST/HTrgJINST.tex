\abstract 
{Significant new challenges are continuously confronting the High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments, in particular the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, where nominal
 conditions deliver proton-proton collisions to the detectors at a rate of 40 MHz. This rate must be significantly reduced to comply with both the performance limitations
 of the mass storage hardware and the capabilities of the computing resources to process the collected data in a timely fashion for physics analysis.  At the same time the physics signals of interest must be retained with high efficiency. 

The quest for rare new physics phenomena at the LHC and the flexibility of the trigger system leads us to evaluate a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) enhancement of the compute farm to not only 
provide faster and more efficient events selection but also include new complex triggers that were not possible before.  A new tracking algorithm is evaluated on a NVIDIA Tesla K20c GPU, allowing for the first time the reconstruction of long lived particles at the tracker system in the trigger. Preliminary time performance and
efficiency will be presented.}

\section{Introduction} 
% 

The stunning performance of the LHC, the successful physics results, and the discovery of 
a new Higgs like particle will mark in history the first LHC running period not as the beginning of the end but rather
the end of the beginning. The first LHC shut down, scheduled for 2 years, provides a remarkable opportunity to
 improve our detector performance even further. In particular to enhance and extend the physics reach that would
 be selected and recorded by the trigger .

The Trigger and Data Acquisition (DAQ) systems~\cite{bib:TDR2} in a modern collider experiment
provide essential preliminary online analysis of the raw data for the purpose of
filtering potentially interesting events into the data storage system.
At the design luminosity of $10^{34}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ this is a formidable task
which requires real time handling of raw data with beam crossings at $40~\mathrm{MHz}$, each yielding
on average ${\sim}20$ inelastic proton-proton events, and producing approximately 1 MB of zero-suppressed data.
To keep the overall data rate within the current capability of the archival storage
system of ${\sim}100~\mathrm{MB}/s$, the trigger system must achieve a rejection ratio for background
events of at least ${\sim}400,000:1$.

The required level of performance can be achieved by implementing a typical trigger system with a
hierarchy of multiple levels, ranging from fast and relatively simple criteria implemented
entirely in hardware and firmware, to more sophisticated software based analysis.  The CMS
trigger is implemented in 2 levels: a hardware Level-1 trigger reducing the event rate
to less than $100~\mathrm{kHz}$, followed by further processing in the High-Level Trigger (HLT)
designed to reduce this maximum Level-1 acceptance rate of 100 kHz to a final output rate of 100 Hz.
A significant component of the HLT is to apply a specific set of
physics selection algorithms on the events read out to accept the events with the most interesting physics 
content. This compute intensive event selection is executed on a farm of commercial CPU processors that
constitute the CMS HLT hardware.

By its very nature of being a computing system the HLT relies on technologies that have evolved
extremely rapidly.  For many decades one of the important methods for improving the performance of computing devices
has been to increase the clock speed of the processor, and the typical CPU clock speed has increased by nearly a factor of 1000.
In the past decade, however, it has been observed that it is no longer possible to rely solely on increases
in processor clock speed as a means for extracting additional computational power from existing architectures.
The underlying reasons are complex, but center around reaching what may be fundamental limitations in
semiconductor device physics.  For this reason, recent innovations have focused around {\em parallel}
processing, either through systems containing multiple processors, or processors containing multiple cores, etc.

One interesting technology which has continued to see exponential growth is graphics processing.  A modern GPU is a massively parallel processor with thousands of executions units to handle highly parallel workloads
related to computer graphics.  By making these execution units highly programmable, manufacturers have made
the massive computational power of a modern GPU available for more general purpose computing,
as opposed to being hard wired for specific
graphical operations.  In certain applications that can be executed in massively parallel fashion, this can yield several 
orders of magnitude better performance than a conventional CPU.


Furthermore, leading technology vendors have released supported development APIs, such as NVIDIA
CUDA ("Compute Unified Device Architecture'')~\cite{bib:CUDA}, which allow rapid development of
software in nearly standard C code.
CUDA allows CPU-based applications to access the resources of a GPU 
for more general purpose computing without the limitations of using a graphics API.
 A modern GPU can simultaneously execute many thousands of computations in parallel, and an application using effective collaboration between the CPU and the GPU can see dramatic acceleration in algorithm execution.

A particularly good application for this technology would be executing machine vision
and pattern recognition algorithms on detector data.  These algorithms are often parallel
by their very nature, and the highly controlled data produced by a particle physics detector
reduces the pattern recognition task to it's purest form.  From the physics perspective,
such an enhancement of the trigger capabilities would allow inclusion of new tracking triggers, for example selection of events with multiple displaced
vertices at any location in the silicon tracker, which could be a smoking gun for new topological
signatures not predicted by the Standard Model.  The proposed tracking upgrade will serve to
augment the existing trigger with new types of trigger filters to select events with topological signatures
that are currently suppressed. 

In the following, a description of the physics motivation behind GPU enhancement of the HLT is provided.
This includes a description of the existing High Level Trigger, 
the GPU and CUDA architecture, and the additional capabilities
which would be enabled by a hybrid GPU/CPU compute farm for the HLT. 
The authors propose a new tracking reconstruction algorithm, show preliminary results,
and a discussion of proposed new triggers that could trigger on new
physics that would be a smoking gun for new physics at the LHC.


\section{Physics Motivation}

Enhancement of the HLT might permit processing of the tracking reconstruction on the full event 
at Level-1 event rate up to design luminosity. The proposed HLT tracking would have a far reaching impact on the physics program 
set by the HLT where the ultimate goal is to select the events of interest for CMS.
The new tracking algorithm will introduce new possible trigger paths that are currently not possible due to the extensive
 processing time that would be required using CPUs alone. The robust parallel processing of the tracking on the 
hybrid CPU/GPU system will allow reconstruction of not only charged prompt tracks from the interaction point
but also reconstruction of displaced vertices in the tracker far beyond what is possible in both CMS/ATLAS.
Therefore the tracking algorithm using the GPU will enrich the physics program and allow for the search of new topological 
signatures that were not possible or suppressed before.

Only a few of the large selection of topological models can be described here. An example of an
interesting class of models which would benefit from such triggers are‚ hidden-valley models~\cite{bib:hiddenvalley}, 
in which a new confining gauge group is added to the standard model. The resulting (electrically-neutral) bound states can have
 low masses and long lifetimes and could be observed at the LHC. The production multiplicities are often large and events with final states with heavy flavor are
common. In addition, displaced vertices and missing energy are possible. Accounting for LEP constraints, LHC production 
cross-sections were estimated to be typically in the 1-100 fb range, though they can be larger.

New tracking triggers would permit selection on the HLT Higgs like decays with a substantial branching fraction to long-lived neutral particles that may decay 
at macroscopic distances from the primary vertex~\cite{bib:hiddenvalley} in the tracker. The limited experimental constraints on light neutral long-lived particles
argues that we probably should not be surprised if a Higgs like reveals itself  through such decays. The lifetimes of these resonances 
are not constrained; decays at centimeter and meter scales are equally possible. Each Higgs decay may produce two or more resonances 
with the multiplicity possibly varying from event to event. In many models the resonances will decay to the heaviest fermion 
pair available, with branching fractions similar to those of the standard model Higgs.  

There are various models that predict these unusual signatures~\cite{bib:hiddenvalley}-\cite{bib:HSV}. 
It includes either simple models where a scalar was added to the Higgs potential or superpotential depending whether a nonsupersymmetric
or supersymmetric framework was used to build the model. 
Or other models that include conÔ¨Åning hidden valley models which showed qualitatively similar signals  though the origin of the signals is 
quite different.  A complex Higgs decay in a hidden-valley model could produce, say, four resonances: one decaying promptly to jets,
 one escaping the detector giving missing energy, and two decaying to bb, each with a displaced vertex.  

Other obvious channels that would benefit from the new tracking algorithm or displaced jets or vertex triggers are inclusive
and exclusive b decay channels or various topologies with boosted jets that will be more frequent as we increase our center of
mass of the collision at design luminosity. These new triggers will allow us to be sensitive to a larger  parameter space 
including lower mass Higgs that could have evaded detection  in previous experiments.

\section{Trigger System}
%

The LHC delivers proton-proton collisions to the CMS~\cite{bib:TP} detector at a rate of 40~MHz. This rate
must be significantly reduced to comply with the performance limitations of the mass storage hardware and the ability
of the offline computing resources to process the collected data in a timely fashion for physics analysis. At the same
time the physics signals of interest must be retained with high efficiency. CMS features a two-level trigger system to reduce
the rate to approximately 100~Hz. The Level-1 trigger~\cite{bib:TDR1} is based on custom hardware and designed to reduce the rate
to about 100~kHz, corresponding to 100~GB/s, assuming an average event size of 1~MB. The High Level Trigger (HLT )~\cite{bib:TDR2},\cite{bib:HLT}
is purely software-based and must achieve the remaining rate reduction by executing sophisticated offline-quality algorithms.
HLT algorithm sequences consist of algorithms that are executed in order of increasing complexity and
the execution of a path is stopped unless evidence for the signal of interest is found. This optimization means more sophisticated and time
consuming reconstruction algorithms are seldom applied. The ability to select the events of interest is the foundation of our 
quest for rare new physics phenomena, and thanks to the flexibility of the CMS HLT software and hardware computing farm the PI is able 
to propose an enhancement for the HLT a few years down the road after startup.

\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

The architecture of the CMS HLT~\cite{bib:TDR2},\cite{bib:HLT} combines the flexibility gained by using the offline
reconstruction~\cite{bib:datamodel} with the robustness required for reliable online operation of the DAQ. Fig.~\ref{fig:hltarc} shows 
a schematic of the architecture of the CMS DAQ system. Event fragments are read out and stored in Readout Units (RU) for each event accepted
by the Level-1 trigger. The fragments are subsequently assembled into complete events by an Event Builder through a complex of switched 
networks into ‚Äúevent buffers‚Äù (BU). The full event content is then handed to one of the HLT Filter Units (FU). The FU execute a series of 
physics reconstruction and filter algorithms and events that are found to be sufficiently interesting for offline analysis are forwarded 
to the Storage Manager (SM). The decoupling of physics algorithm execution from data flow allows each FU to continue operation, recover the
content of the problematic event, and forward it to be stored unprocessed. The FU architecture consists of 
two separate applications, the ResourceBroker, which exchanges data with the DAQ, and the EventProcessor, which integrates the reconstruction
software. Given the involved event sizes and rates, reformatting raw events consisting of a large number of small data fragments into the physical 
memory of a Filter Unit requires high bandwidth I/O, while the subsequent HLT processing is mostly CPU intensive.
The EventProcessor previously mentioned encapsulates the event processing machinery of the CMS reconstruction, providing the full flexibility 
required to execute complex physics algorithms. 

The farms of commercial processors where these event selection are executed is a natural place where the GPU cards could be integrated.
A simple prototype solution is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:integratedsys} where a 1U server made up of a motherboard with two PCI-e x16 slots would allow installation of two GPU Host Interface Cards (HIC) onto the system without using additional hardware to host 
the GPU server.  While this would provide a single, integrated 1U GPU/CPU server this of course implies replacing the existing servers, 
evaluating the new power consumption, and the cost of these servers relative to any other multi core option.



\section{Inner Tracker}

Both the CMS and ATLAS inner tracker include a silicon pixel detector and a silicon strip detector.
All tracker layers provide two-dimensional hit position measurements, but only the pixel tracker
 and a subset of the strip tracker layers provide three dimensional hit position measurements.
In the following only the CMS tracker would be considered however the detector performances are comparable
in CMS/ATLAS experiments and the tracking algorithm and results discussed are applicable for both of 
these experiments as well. The CMS pixel detector includes three barrel layers and two forward disks
on either end of the detector surrounded by  ten strip detectors barrel layers plus three 
inner disks and nine forward disks at each end of the detector.
Owing to the strong magnetic field and the high granularity of the silicon tracker, 
promptly produced charged particles with transverse momentum $pT = 100$ GeV/c are reconstructed 
with a resolution in pT of 1.5\% and in transverse impact
parameter d0 of 15 mm. The track reconstruction algorithms are able to reconstruct displaced
tracks with transverse impact parameters up to 25 cm from particles decaying up to 50 cm
from the beam line. The performance of the track reconstruction algorithms has been studied
with data [11]. The silicon tracker is also used to reconstruct the primary vertex position with
 a precision of $\sigma_d 20$ mm in each dimension. 



\section{Fast Tracking Algorithm}

One possible application of the GPU enabled parallelism would be to
accelerate the performance of the existing Kalman fitter used for tracking reconstruction.
Since the iterative Kalman process for each track is largely independent of the other tracks,
parallelization should not be conceptually difficult. However, an additional motivating 
force behind the use of GPU in the HLT is to be able to investigate the possibility of 
running trigger algorithms which are dramatically and qualitatively different in nature 
to enhance the discovery potential.

As an example, the Hough Transform is a well known algorithm used in various machine
vision applications that differs from the Kalman approach in that it does not operate on
localized features of a data set.  Rather the technique is in some sense more
holistic, operating on an entire image as a whole.
The technique is described at length in existing literature, but the concept as it would be applicable to the
tracking problem is to consider the parameterization of any given track.  Any given hit
observed in the detector can correspond to many different possible tracks in parameter
space but when integrated over the entire data set, peaks appear in parameter space
at the values corresponding to the actual, physical trajectories.  As was briefly described
previously, the traditional Kalman approach implicitly depends on various assumptions and
constraints on the phase space of the seed tracks, with one of the most significant
results being suppression of displaced vertices.  It is hoped that a more holistic algorithm
can be used to supplement the existing tracking algorithm in a significant way.

As a demonstration of this, a simple tracking algorithm was developed 
and run against a stand alone Monte Carlo simulation with a simple tracker geometry file. 
The preliminary investigation was performed on a modest testbench consisting XXX Machine
with NVIDIA Tesla C2075 and K20c GPU cards........
